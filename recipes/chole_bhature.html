    <h3>How to make Chole Bhature</h3>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1.5 cups all-purpose flour (maida)</li>
        <li> â…“ cup sooji (rava or fine semolina)</li>
        <li>Â½ tablespoon oil or ghee</li>
        <li>Â½ tablespoon granulated fine sugar</li>
        <li> Â¼ teaspoon baking soda Â½ teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li> Â½ teaspoon salt or as required</li>
        <li>2 to 3 tablespoons water for kneading or add as needed</li>
        <li>Â½ cup curd (yogurt)</li>
        <li>oil for deep frying</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Sieve the all-purpose flour (maida), salt, baking soda and baking powder in a mixing bowl. Then add the semolina and sugar to the sifted ingredients.</li>
        <li>Now add the curd (yogurt). With a spoon mix the yogurt with the sifted ingredients.</li>
        <li>Adding 2 to 3 tablespoons water in parts and at intervals, first mix well and then start kneading. Knead to a smooth, supple and soft dough.</li>
        <li>Cover the dough with a wet cotton napkin and keep aside to rest for 30 to 45 minutes or up-to 2 hours.</li>
        <li>Later pinch medium sized balls from the dough. Roll each ball between your palms to a round shape.<br> Keep the dough ball on your work surface and flatten lightly with your fingers. Spread a bit of oil on both sides of the dough ball.<br> Using a rolling pin, roll into an oval or elongated shape. You can also make a round shape.</li>
        <li>In a kadai or wok, keep oil for deep frying on medium-high flame. Drop the rolled dough in hot oil and it will start puffing within a minute.</li>
        <li>When the sizzling of the oil stops, turn over and fry the other side. You can flip once or twice for even cooking.</li>
        <li>When light golden or golden, remove the bhatura and drain on paper towels to remove excess oil. This way fry the bhatura in batches.</li>
    </ol>
